# Run Command

## Purpose:
An experimental Java program that change the directory and execute a cmd command in the terminal. 

## Notes:
- User can input and change to new desired directory in System.
- The cmd command "dir" is hardcoded as the additional command. This can later be changed to user desired command. 
- cmd command "pwd" outputs error when replacing "dir" command.
