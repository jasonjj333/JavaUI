# Item Generator Test

## Purpose: 
A java program using Swing that will create a GUI for Argo Data's Item Generator program.

## How to run:
Build and run **UITest.java** as it is the main Runner for UIFramework2.java. UIFramework.java was an initial attempt and will be deleted
or renamed. UIFramework2.java creates the UI. UIFramework3.java is an update currently in work to use custom icons and layout.

## What is implemented:
- **Output location** combo box created to select local/database location. File Chooser opens to
current directory when local is selected and allows user to select desired directory. 
- **Cycle Number** check box and text field created. Text field can only be edited when check box is 
selected.
- **Max Items** check box and text field created. Text field can only be edited when check box is 
selected.
- **AIF Debits Only** check box reated.
- **Execute** Button created. Prints information on output location, cycle number, max items,
and aif debits only if selected. 
- Return the correct String of the desired cmd command when execute button is pressed.
- 
## What to work on: 
- Validate all entries are reasonable when execute is pressed. (Needs Check box testing).
- Make an executable for this program. 
- Add a style. 
- Add icons. 
- Add remaining selection features when given.
