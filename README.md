##runCommand##
Purpose: An experimental Java program that change the directory and execute a cmd command in the terminal. 

Notes:
User can input new desired directory in System.
The cmd command "dir" is hardcoded as the additional command. This can later be changed to user desired command. 
I can only test with D:\ because terminal is originally created in D drive.
